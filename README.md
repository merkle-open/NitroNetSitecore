NitroNet for Sitecore extends [NitroNet](https://github.com/namics/NitroNet) with the support for the WCMS [Sitecore](http://www.sitecore.net).  
It handles all possible presentation scenarios to integrate a [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) frontend into Sitecore without functional loss. In addition it's possible to get a hybrid integration with handlebars frontends (based on simple and logic-less view pages) and own Razor views (*.cshtml).

### NitroNet for Sitecore features
There are [many features which come with NitroNet](https://github.com/namics/NitroNet#nitronet-features) alone. On top of that NitroNet for Sitecore offers the following things:
- Support for the following Sitecore characteristics:
	- MVC based renderings (e.g. Controller Rendering)
	- Placeholders
	- Full support for the Experience Editor
	- Personalization
	- etc...
- Caching which fully integrates into the Sitecore caching mechanisms
- Out of the box integration as view engine
- Different NuGets for supported Sitecore versions and your preferred IoC framework

### What's NitroNet?
[NitroNet](https://github.com/namics/NitroNet) is a handlebars view engine with an intelligent built-in file system and the possibility to add custom helpers. Because of these two features NitroNet differs from other existing handlebars view engines.

### ... and whats Nitro?
[Nitro](https://github.com/namics/generator-nitro/) is a Node.js application for simple and complex frontend development with a tiny footprint. It provides a proven but flexible structure to develop your frontend code, even in a large team.

## Credits and special thanks
Thanks to all the people who made and released these awesome resources for free!

Special thanks to [Marco Schälle](https://github.com/marcoschaelle) and [Stefan Schälle](https://github.com/schaelle) who fight for a smart way to integrate Frontends into ASP.NET and created the predecessor [TerrificNet](https://github.com/namics/TerrificNet) of NitroNet itself. Marco and Stefan were our opinion leaders of this product.

Also special thanks to [Mark Cassidy](https://github.com/cassidydotdk) for all product commits and propagation of our idea to the whole world.
