### ...and NitroNet for Sitecore ?

The name says it all: NitroNet for Sitecore is a special View-Engine, based on ASP.NET MVC for the Content Management System [Sitecore](http://www.sitecore.net). It handles all possible presentation scenarios to integrate a Nitro-Frontend into Sitecore without functional loss (Sublayouting, Placeholders, Experience-Editor Full-Support, Personalization, ...). In addition it's possible to get a hybrid integration with Nitro-Frontends (based on simple and logic-less View-Pages) and own Razor-Views (*.cshtml).
